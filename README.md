Football is a global game that connects almost every single person on the planet. No other sport in the history of humankind has beem able to penetrate into countries of varying cultures and continents. Although the TV viewership is much more higher for men's football, the women's football is slowly but steadily catching up to its male counterpart and is slowly starting to grab a lot of global attention.

In this notebook, we will use an up-to-date dataset of over 4,000 women's international football results which includes:

- date: date of the match
- home_team: the name of the home team
- away_team: the name of the away team
- home_score: full-time home team score including extra time, not including penalty-shootouts
- away_score: full-time away team score including extra time, not including penalty-shootouts
- tournament: the name of the tournament
- city: the name of the city/town/administrative unit where the match was played
- country: the name of the country where the match was played
- neutral: TRUE/FALSE column indicating whether the match was played at a neutral venue

Our objective is to analyze this dataset and gain some interesting insights.
